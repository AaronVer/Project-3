    Hello, this is Gideon Johnson.

    I have implemented a module called "axios-rate-limit" into various files which use Axios as
a means of protecting against DDoS vulenrabilities. However, this does not inherently come with Axios, React
or anything else you already have. So if you downloaded this from Github or a pipeline, it is likely that you
will encounter a "Module Not Found" error, as you do not have it.

    To resolve this, simply open up command prompt, navigate into the CacheMoney project, cd into the "Frontend" folder, and 
enter the command: "npm install axios-rate-limit".

    If this does not work or you are unable to do this, then you will have to remove the lines of coding that use this module.
To do this, go into the following files within Frontend:
    components/Account/AccountList.js
    components/Account/CreateAccount.js
    components/Transaction/Deposit.js
    components/Transaction/TransactionTable.js
    components/Transaction/Transfer.js
    components/Transaction/TransferSelection.js
    components/Transaction/Withdraw.js
    components/RegisterView.js
    components/SigninView.js

    ...and remove the following lines of coding from all of them:
    
    //Implementing patch to fix Axios DDoS vulnerability.
    import rateLimit from 'axios-rate-limit';
    const http = rateLimit(axios.create(), { maxRequests: 2, perMilliseconds: 1000, maxRPS: 2 })
